# BQ5 - Fix the radio button

There are some radio button in the `index.html`. Write a program such that it will `console.log` the value of the selected
radio button. However, you **need to tweak the HTML code for the radio buttons** as well. 

## Your task

1. Create your own `script.js`

2. Duplicate `index.template.html` and name the copy as `index.html` (do not simply rename, make sure to make a copy first)

3. Write the code such that

    * When the button is clicked
    * ...display using `console.log` the **value** of the selected radio button

3. If no checkbox has been selected, use `console.log` to display the integer 0.
