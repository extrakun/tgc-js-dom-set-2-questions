# BQ4 - display the largest checkbox

There are some checkboxes.

## Your task

1. Create your own `script.js`

2. Uncomment the `<script src='script.js'></script>` in `index.html`

2. Write the code such that

    * When the button is clicked
    * ...display using `console.log` the **value**, as an *integer*, of the checked checkbox with the largest value

3. If no checkbox has been selected, use `console.log` to display the integer 0.


## Hint

* Values in checkboxes are stored as **strings**
