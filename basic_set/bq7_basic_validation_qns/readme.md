# BQ6 - Change polarity

There are some checkboxes and two radio buttons. Each checkbox is associated with a numerical value. The two radio buttons allow us
to select whether to sum up or to multiply.

## Your task

1. Create your own `script.js`

2. Uncomment the `<script src='script.js'></script>` in `index.html`

2. Write the code such that

    * When the button is clicked
    * ...sum up or multiply all the values from the selected checkbox, depending on which radio button is checked.

3. If no checkbox has been selected, use `console.log` to display the integer 0.


## Hint

* Values in checkboxes are stored as **strings**. Make sure all operations are done with integers.
